> Django Ninja is a web framework for building APIs with Django and Python 3.6+ type hints.

## Key features:
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and intuitive.
- FAST execution: Very high performance thanks to Pydantic and async support.
- Fast to code: Type hints and automatic docs lets you focus only on business logic.
- Standards-based: Based on the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
- Django friendly: (obviously) has good integration with the Django core and ORM.

## Project

This project will be a test of the Django Ninja framework and getting to know it a little bit. I will build an API which will load the data 
from the database and present it to the user. Basic CRUD functionality. From the description it should be somewhere in between 
DjangoREST and Flask in terms of complexity.
